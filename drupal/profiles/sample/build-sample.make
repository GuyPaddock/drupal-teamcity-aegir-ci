; This file "bootstraps" the build of a complete Drupal platform that includes.
; This file triggers Drush to download the version of Drupal specified in
; "drupal-org-core.make" and then start building the rest of the installation

; "drupal-org.make" to download the contrib modules and patches that the
; profile requires.
